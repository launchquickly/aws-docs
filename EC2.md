# EC2

Elastic Compute Cloud

- Provides resizable compute capacity  
- Provides scalable infrastructure  


On Demand - allow you to pay fixed rate by the hour with no commitement  
Reserved - provide with a capacity reservation to recieve a discount charge based on terms. Typically 1 to 3 years.  
Spot - bid for free compute capacity as it becomes available  
Dedicated Hosts - physical EC2 server dedicated for your use.  

Reserved - steady state or predictable usage
         - make upfront payments to receive discount
Spot - applications have flexible start and end times
     - applications only feasible at very low compute prices
     - users with urgent compute needs for large compute requirements
Dedicated Hosts - regulatory requirements
                - licensing reasons
                - can be discounted on long terms

Spot - if instance is terminated by Amazon for partial hour you will not be billed for that hour  
     - if instance is terminated by you for partial hour then you will be billed for that hour
